# UI documents: widgets and views as data

**Covers:** Building game UI as UI documents (ui/**/*.ui.json, ADR 0122), the format the editor's UI documents mode edits — widgets (buttons, toggles, chips, bars, rows) and views (screens, dialogs) made and changed with `gameengine ui doc` (MCP ui_doc_*), never hand-written JSON. Covers layers (elements, labels, icons, placed widgets, repeats, code areas), layout, anchors, images and text; a widget's face (text, number, yes/no, enum, list, choice, image and trigger properties) and its events; states and poses (Pressed, Disabled, yes/no and enum values, number Empty/Full with Range/Steps/Smooth drivers, Fill, lit up to, reactions, Enter/Exit) and their transitions; lists (Repeat, groups, tab bars, virtual scrolling lists); screens and dialogs on the view stack; placing a document from a thin TSX view (<Widget doc props onIntent refs codeAreas>, src/ui.gen.ts), samples, renders and tests. Use for every new HUD, menu, popup, button or widget, and whenever a ui/**/*.ui.json changes.

A **UI document** (`ui/**/*.ui.json`) is a widget or a whole screen that a person can open and tune in the
editor's **UI documents** mode. The split, from ADR 0122:

- **The document holds the looks:** structure, layout, images, text, and every look that follows state
  (Pressed, a toggle's on, an enum's value, a number's position, a reaction, a view's Enter / Exit).
- **Code holds the flow and the motion:** a thin `defineView` places the document, fills its properties from
  the model and turns its events into intents (skill `ui-mvc-views` for views, controllers and the stack).
  Entrances, loops, staggers and one-off moments are `ui.animate` in that view.

New UI is documents: every new HUD, screen, popup, button or row. A TSX-only view is for what documents cannot
hold (end of this skill). A project with older TSX views ports them with the `ui-views-to-documents` skill.

## The loop

Edit documents only with `gameengine ui doc` (MCP `ui_doc_list`, `ui_doc_show`, `ui_doc_check`, `ui_doc_edit`).
It runs the editor's own edits, checks every document alone and the whole set as `pnpm gen` does, and writes
all its files or none: a refused edit writes nothing and names the field. It keeps GUIDs and fixes the
documents that place the one it changes. Hand-written JSON skips all of that.

```sh
gameengine ui doc list                      # every document: kind, file, title, properties
gameengine ui doc show chip                 # read this, not the JSON: layers + style, properties, poses with their flags, events, where used
# … edits (below) …
gameengine ui doc check                     # the whole set
gameengine gen                              # src/ui.gen.ts: <Widget doc> props, code areas and refs as types
gameengine view render doc:chip --sample rich --devices --out chip.png   # look at it on a slim and a wide phone
```

`--dry-run` on any edit says what it would write. `--json` on any command gives the result as data (new layer
ids, files). The editor follows the files: a saved document hot-reloads in place in the editor and a running game.

## Kinds and behaviours

| Make | Command | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| A widget (button, chip, bar, row, card) | `ui doc new reward-chip` | `kind: widget`, a row root to build in |
| A screen or dialog | `ui doc new shop --kind view` | `kind: view`, a full-size root, `behaviour: screen` |
| A tab bar | `ui doc new tabs --kind tab-bar` | the bar (a Repeat of toggles in an Exactly-one group over a `tabs` list, `selected` choice) and its private `tabs-tab` |
| Step progress, stars | `ui doc new steps --kind segmented-bar` | a row lit up to `progress` over `steps` segments, and its private segment toggle |

A widget's `behaviour` is what it does when pressed: `ui doc settings <doc> behaviour=button` (sends its key) or
`behaviour=toggle` (flips its yes/no `on`, sends `changed`), default `none`. Only buttons and toggles have the
Pressed and Disabled states. A view's behaviour is how the stack shows it (below). `title=` names it in the editor.

Build in place, then promote: `ui doc make-widget shop s_card shop-card` turns a container you built into its own
widget document, placed where it was (refused while the holder's poses change layers inside it, or a code area
sits inside it: move those looks into the new widget as a property first). Make a widget for anything shown twice (a button, a chip, a row).

## Layers

```sh
gameengine ui doc add reward element --parent root --id r_panel --set dir=column --set pad="24 20" --set image=ui/panel
gameengine ui doc add reward label --parent r_panel --id r_title --text '{coins} coins' --set fontSize=28 --set weight=800
gameengine ui doc add reward icon --parent r_panel --id r_coin --set image=ui/sprites/coin --set size=48
gameengine ui doc add reward use --parent r_panel --id r_collect --doc button --key collect   # place a widget
gameengine ui doc add reward repeat --parent r_list --doc reward-row --property rewards  # one copy per list item
gameengine ui doc add reward codeArea --parent r_panel --key particles                  # an empty box code fills
gameengine ui doc set reward r_title color=#ffcc00 fitMin=18        # field=value on the base look ("" clears)
gameengine ui doc move reward r_coin --parent r_panel --index 0 · duplicate · remove
```

- Name layers with `--id` in the document's short prefix (`r_title`); poses and `set` refer to them, and without
  one the result names the id it made (`rew_button`).
- **Elements** are containers (every element can hold children, show an image and be pressed).
- **Labels:** `--text 'Level {level}'` shows a property inside text; `property=title` makes the whole text a
  property a holder sets; `loc:key` localises. A label never changes its text per state: two labels with hide
  poses, or a text property.
- **Icons:** `image=` a texture key (no extension): a white glyph tinted by `color`, or a sprite in its own
  colours; `property=icon` lets holders pick it (an `image` property).
- **Any layer:** `show=<yes/no property>` shows it only while that is yes; `point=target` names it as a point
  (where a reward flies to: `ui.animateTo(icons, { to: 'coins.target' })`, skill `ui-mvc-views`).
- A new element pads 8 and a new view's root has a background: set `pad=0` or `bg=` where the design has none.
  A field the layer does not take is refused with the list of those it does.

**Layout** (UI Toolkit's flex model, reference px): `dir` (`column`/`row`), `align`, `justify`, `w`/`h` (`auto`,
a number, `50%`), `grow` (`w=0 grow=1` for equal shares), `gap`, `pad` / `margin` (`"t r b l"` or one number),
`hide`, `clip=true` (clips children). **Anchored** (taken out of the flow, placed on the parent):
`position=anchored anchor="1 0" offset="-8 8"` (anchor 0–1 of the parent; `pivot` follows the anchor unless set,
`centre` or `"x y"`). Use anchors for overlaps (a badge on a corner, a ribbon): a negative `margin` does not lay out as in CSS. Set `attach=true` on an element placed over or past its parent on purpose (a badge, a ribbon): layout
warnings then leave it out of the escape and overlap checks.

**Paint:** `bg` (`#rrggbbaa`), `radius`, `opacity`, `tx`/`ty`/`scale`/`rotate` (the cheap fields to animate in
poses; never animate `w`/`h`). **Images:** `image=ui/panel` on any element, 9-sliced by the texture's own `.gmeta`
borders (fix a border there, not per element; `sliceScale` scales it), its `.gmeta` body drawn past the box (a
hard shadow) and its content padding used while the element sets none; `fit`, `flip`, `keepCaps` (a Fill that grows
the 9-slice instead of clipping it: a clipped pill loses its round end, so turn it on for every filling button,
counter or bar), `imageSwap=cut|fade` for images swapped by poses; colour in order `tint` (+ `tintMode`
colorize | multiply, `tintAmount`), `saturation`, `brightness`, `imageAlpha` (Grey out: `saturation=0` on the same
texture). **Fill:** `fill=horizontal|vertical|radial`, `fillAmount` 0–1, `fillOrigin`: a clip reveal for bars
and rings. **Text:** `fontSize` (max) with `fitMin` (shrinks to fit), `weight`, `color`, `textAlign`, `outline` +
`outlineColor` (outside the letters, at most 0.2 em), `shadowX/Y` + `shadowColor` + `shadowSoft`.

**Text artifacts:** an outline of about 0.06 em or more on text drawn small on screen (a scaled-down game
view, a slim phone) can show a faint box in the outline colour around each letter (engine shader bug).
Check outlined labels at the smallest size (`gameengine view render <View> --devices`) and report boxes
rather than thinning outlines to hide them. Judge a rebuilt engine only in a fresh `gameengine run
--headless` or a restarted editor: a long-running process keeps drawing with the old binary.

## A widget's face: properties and events

Properties are what a holder sets; events are what it hears. `ui doc show` lists both, `src/ui.gen.ts` types them.

| Type | Make it | Drives |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | `prop add card title --type text --default Shop` | a label's `property=` or `{title}` in its text |
| `number` | `prop add chip amount --type number --format thousands` | `{amount}` in a label (`value`, `thousands`, `compact`, `percent`, `fraction`); with a Range, Empty / Full poses, Fill, lit up to |
| `yesno` | `prop add card sale --type yesno --default no` | a `no` and a `yes` pose; `show=sale` on layers |
| `enum` | `prop add mission status --type enum --values locked,active,claimable,claimed` | one pose per value (kebab-case words) |
| `list` | `prop add board entries --type list --of lb-row` | a Repeat stamping `lb-row` per item; items are `{ key, …lb-row's properties }` |
| `choice` | `prop add tabs selected --type choice --list tabs` | the key of the copy that is on (`selected=` on the Repeat) |
| `image` | `prop add card art --type image --default ui/sprites/gem` | an icon's `property=` |
| `trigger` | `prop add chip denied --type trigger` | a reaction; the holder fires it by changing a counter |

`prop rename` / `prop remove` move or drop what every placing document gives it, its samples included.

**Placing a widget** (`add … use --doc button --key collect`): its key is the name of its events and the element
id tests press. Set its properties by name: `ui doc set shop s_buy label=Buy` (a literal), `price=@price` (bound
to the holder's property, so a view-level value reaches it), `label=loc:shop.buy`, `count=3`, `on=true`. A use's
own style places it (`w`, `margin`, `grow`, anchors); a holder's poses may only `hide`, fade, move, scale or
rotate a placed widget, never restyle its inside: give the widget a property or an enum for that.

**Events the holder hears:** a placed button's key (`collect`); a toggle's `<key>: changed` (with `on`); an inner
widget's event through each holder's key (`coins: plus`); a Repeat copy's with its item key
(`missions: claim (m3)`); a dialog's `dismiss` (`tapOutside=dismiss`). A view document adds no prefix of its own.

## States and poses

A **pose** is a set of field changes on the document's layers. Poses stack in layers, later ones winning:
number blends (Empty → Full), then yes/no and enum values, then the Interaction states (Pressed, Disabled), then
reactions on top. Set a field in one with the flag `ui doc show` prints next to it:

```sh
gameengine ui doc set button b_root scale=0.92 ty=2 --state pressed
gameengine ui doc set button b_root saturation=0 opacity=0.6 --state disabled     # <Widget disabled={…}> drives it
gameengine ui doc set toggle t_knob anchor="1 0.5" offset="-4 0" --pose on=yes
gameengine ui doc set mission mr_claim hide=false scale=1.06 --pose status=claimable
gameengine ui doc set card c_ribbon hide=true --pose sale=no
gameengine ui doc set reward root opacity=0 scale=0.86 --pose enter              # a view's Enter from / Exit to
```

**Transitions** have fixed durations (a view's exit and the scrim keep time with them). The document's default:
`ui doc settings button transition="back 240 1.4"`; a pose's own: `ui doc set button b_root
transition="easeOut 100" --state pressed` (it is the whole pose's, whichever layer you name; `""` returns it to
the default). A reaction has its own `in=` and `back=` instead. Forms: `instant`, `easeOut <ms>`,
`easeInOut <ms>`, `linear <ms>`, `back <ms> [overshoot]`, `elastic <ms> <amplitude> <period>`. Keep presses
around 100–150 ms and poses 200–350 ms.

### Numbers that drive looks

A number gets **drivers**, applied top to bottom, so order matters: Smooth then Steps eases and snaps each
shown value to whole steps (a counter), Steps then Smooth eases between snapped targets. A change keeps a driver
where it is, a new one goes last, and `--index n` puts it at a position:

```sh
gameengine ui doc driver bar progress range min=0 maxFrom=goal     # clamp and give a 0–1 position (max=100, or follow another number)
gameengine ui doc driver chip amount smooth min=300 max=1200       # count up, longer for a bigger change (ms)
gameengine ui doc driver chip amount steps by=1                    # then snap what it shows to whole numbers
gameengine ui doc set bar pb_fill fillAmount=0 --pose progress=empty
gameengine ui doc set bar pb_fill fillAmount=1 bg=#7cf29aff --pose progress=full   # blended by the position
gameengine ui doc set steps root lit=progress                      # toggle children lit up to the number
gameengine ui doc driver chip amount steps --index 0                # move Steps first
gameengine ui doc driver chip amount steps --remove
```

The Range's 0–1 position is what Empty / Full poses blend by and what `lit` lights up to.

### Reactions

A **reaction** is a moment over everything else: it plays in, holds and plays back by itself when a number goes
up or down, or a trigger fires (a chip's Gain, a Denied shake):

```sh
gameengine ui doc reaction chip gain on=amount change=up when=end in="easeOut 90" hold=110 back="elastic 420 1.2 0.3"
gameengine ui doc set chip c_root scale=1.12 --reaction gain
gameengine ui doc reaction chip denied on=denied change=trigger in="easeOut 40" hold=60 back="elastic 480 1 0.3"
gameengine ui doc set chip c_root bg=#c0392bff tx=9 --reaction denied
```

A new reaction starts as the editor's does (the root scaled to 1.1; in easeOut 90, hold 110, back elastic 420;
a number's waits for its Smooth to arrive, `when=end`; `when=now` plays at once). Give only what differs, and
set its look with `--reaction`. The holder fires a trigger by giving it a new value:
`props={{ denied: () => model().deniedCount }}`.

## Lists, groups and toggles

- **Repeat** stamps a widget once per item where it sits: `--property rewards` (a list: one copy per item, each
  item's fields as the copy's properties), `--property steps` (a number: that many), or `--count 3`. `gap=`,
  `grow=true` (copies share the width: tabs), `selected=<choice>` (the copy that is on).
- **List items** come from code (`props={{ rewards: () => model().rewards }}`, each `{ key, … }`; the key is
  what events carry) or a list's `--default '[{"key":"a","label":"A"}]'` for previews.
- **Groups:** `ui doc set tabs root group=one` (exactly one on: tabs), `oneOrNone`, `many`; the holder hears
  `<key>: changed` with `selection`. **Lit up to:** `lit=<number>` turns its toggle children on up to it.
- **Scrolling:** `ui doc set board b_list scroll="vertical items bounce"` (`horizontal`, snap `items` or
  `pages`, `bounce`). A Repeat **alone** in a scroll element whose row widget has a fixed size (`h=` on its root)
  is **virtual**: only the rows in view exist (10k rows are about 160 nodes). Keep long lists virtual.

## Screens and dialogs

A view document on the view stack brings its own behaviour:

```sh
gameengine ui doc settings no-lives behaviour=dialog dims=yes tapOutside=dismiss
gameengine ui doc settings shop behaviour=screen safe=yes
```

- `screen` covers the views under it (they play Exit and leave the tree until it is popped); `dialog` blocks
  the views below and the stack's one scrim (`ui.scrim` in `project.gameengine.json`) dims behind it (`dims`).
  Never draw a backdrop in the document.
- Its Enter / Exit poses (`--pose enter`, `--pose exit`) are the view's entrance and exit unless `defineView` or
  `views.push` sets one. Use one or the other, never both.
- `safe=yes` (default) keeps the root's content inside the safe area; a direct child of the root set to
  `safeArea=full` reaches the screen edges under the notch (a background, a top bar's colour).

## Placing a document from code

```tsx
// src/views/reward.view.tsx: the view stays thin; ui.gen.ts types props, codeAreas and refs.
export const RewardView = defineView<RewardModel>({
  name: 'Reward',
  description: 'Coins won and Collect. Intents: collect, dismiss.',
  samples: { small: { coins: 120, adReady: true }, big: { coins: 99999, adReady: false } },
  render: (model, { intent }) => (
    <Widget
      doc="reward"
      props={{ coins: () => model().coins, adReady: () => model().adReady }}
      codeAreas={{ particles: <Particles effect="vfx/confetti.vfx.json" /> }}
      refs={(key, node) => key === 'collect' && ui.animate(node, 'fx-pulse-loop')}
      sounds={{ collect: 'audio/ui/collect' }}
      onIntent={(_, e) => intent(e.path.at(-1)!)}
    />
  ),
});
```

- `props` take values or functions (reactive). `codeAreas` fill code areas by key (a placed widget's as
  `<key>.<area>`): what you pass stays yours across reloads. `refs` gets each point and placed widget's node
  by key (`coins.target` nested), again after a hot reload: start motion there.
- On the `<Widget>`: `disabled` drives a button's Disabled state, `haptic` / `sound` set a button document's own
  feedback, `sounds` a placed button's by key, `id` prefixes every element id and event (`pause.resume`).
- **Event keys and ids:** a view document placed without `id` sends its placed widgets' keys as they are, and
  they are the element ids (`ui.press('collect')`). A *widget* document placed without `id` (`<Widget
  doc="button">`) is keyed by a slug of its first text property's value, else the document name: give it an
  `id`, or read the pressed key as `e.path.at(-1)`.
- `refs` runs while the widget builds, after the effects the view created first: start an entrance that depends
  on the state at open from `refs`, and react to later changes from an effect.
- A view whose render is one view document is pushed like any view (`views.push(RewardView, model)`); controllers
  and models are unchanged by documents.
- Export the view from `src/main.ts` (or a file it imports): `view list` and `view render` find views in the bundle.
- Screen fit stays in TSX/CSS: place widget documents inside the view's anchors (`.a-top`, `.a-bot`) with a class
  that positions them; documents read no `@media` or CSS variables (skill `screen-fit`).

## Samples, renders and tests

- Give every state a document can show a sample: `ui doc sample mission claimable status=claimable progress=20
  goal=20` (`--remove` drops one). `view render doc:<name> --sample <s> --devices` renders it alone;
  `--times 0,0.1,0.2,0.4` makes a contact sheet of a transition. Look at the PNG.
- `view render` draws the document alone: the stack's dim behind a dialog is not in the picture.
- Game tests press documents like TSX: `ui.press('collect')`, `ui.rect('coins.target')`, and read the events your
  view turned into intents.

## Cost on phones

- Opening a view is mostly script, about 0.3 ms per placed widget on a phone-low device: a screen of 40 widgets
  is about 12 ms, so prefer a few widgets with properties over many tiny ones, and keep long lists virtual.
- A pose change restyles only the nodes it touches; an idle document costs nothing per frame. Transitions and
  reactions play natively; a Smooth driver runs a little script each frame only while its number moves. Do not
  change a property every frame from code: set the target and let Smooth ease it.

## What stays TSX

`<Text rich>`, `<Particles>`, `<Model>`, `<Skeleton>`, `<Flipbook>` and `<Pooled>` go in a **code area**.
Per-aspect layout (`@media`, anchors on the screen), `max-width` / `min-width` / `align-self`, and a per-button
haptic stronger than the project's `ui.button` default stay in the view's TSX/CSS. A view that is mostly code
areas (a 3D portrait, a particle showcase) can stay a TSX view (skill `ui-mvc-views`).

## Traps

- Not refused is not right: render it and look. Read the warnings too: an unused property, or an `image` swapped
  in a pose (it jumps instead of animating; prefer a second element faded with `opacity`).
- `ui doc delete` (refused while something places it) and `ui doc rename` (every reference follows; TSX naming
  the old name is listed for you to fix), never `rm` or `mv`.
- Run `gameengine gen` after document edits and before typechecking the view: a stale `ui.gen.ts` fails `tsc` on
  a property that exists.
- Names: documents kebab-case, properties and reactions camelCase, enum values and points kebab-case.
- `image` keys have no extension (`ui/panel`); a missing border belongs in the texture's `.gmeta`.
- A toggle's value names (`valueNames`, sent as `value` with `changed`) are set in the editor's Widget panel;
  `ui doc` has no command for them yet.
